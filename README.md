## Random Joke Generator
Ever run out of jokes to tell your friends? Well this interface can help with that! The random joke generator will output a joke with a setup and a punchline. If you found a joke to be one of your favorites, you can like the joke and have it saved. 


## Why should I make it?
The Random Joke Generator is a fun way to pass the time by telling your friends jokes that were generated to you. The age appropriate jokes in our system makes it applicable to any setting, work, outing, or at a party!


## Setup
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `json-server --watch db.json` to get the backend started
- Run `npm install -g live-server` to install live-server globally
- Run `live-server` to start the frontend in browser
- Write your code in the `index.js` file
- As you are writing your code out and completing the deliverables ensure that it works on the DOM and passes the tests by running `npm test` in a new terminal in the same directory


## How to Use it?
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open in a web browser.
3. Click 'create' to have a random joke generated
4. Click the 'Like' button, if you enjoyed the joke
5. If you're wanting to particpate, feel free to add you own joke. Make sure to add each section: type of joke (subject), setup, and the punchline
6. Experiment with the generator and explore various jokes within different type/subjects

## Endpoints
